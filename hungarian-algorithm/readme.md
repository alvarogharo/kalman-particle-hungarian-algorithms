# Hungarian algorithm
The algorithm uses a different random and unique color for each object to track. There are only 8 colors defined, if there
are more than 8 objects/detections in your images add more colors to the colors list in the ```main.py``` file. 

The objective for this algorithm is that a bbox with a specific color always surrounds the same object in all the frames.
